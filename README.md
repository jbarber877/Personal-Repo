Repository of Personal and School Projects

## Computer Organization
From CDA 3101 Spring 2022. Contains ARM code written for use with the Quemu Arm emulator using Legv8. Scripts are stored in txt format for grading and readability
| Arm
|--- pa1.txt 
|    The code takes a string as input, calculates the length of the string, and determines whetherthe string is a palindrome
|--- pa2.txt
|    The code takes two integer inputs, x and y, and recursively calculates x ^ y. If y is <= 0, the output is assumed to be zero.
|Cache
|--- Cache.cpp
|    C++ code simulates a computer cache to compare efficiency. Includes direct mapped, full associative, and set associative caches using FIFO and LRU replacement.
|--- Cache Analysis
|    Analysis of the results of Cache.cpp

## Data Structures
Built-from scratch implementations of common data structures in Computer Science
| MinHeap.cpp
|--- C++ implementation of a MinHeap, a binary tree data structure where the value of each parent node is less than or equal to the values of its children nodes, ensuring the minimum value is always at the root.
| SplayTree.cpp
|--- C++ implementation of a splay tree, a self-adjusting binary search tree where frequently accessed nodes are moved closer to the root to improve access times, utilizing the splay operation for efficient restructuring.
