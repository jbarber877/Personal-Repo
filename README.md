# Personal-Repo
Repository of Personal and School Projects

## Computer Organization
From CDA 3101 Spring 2022. Contains ARM code written for use with the Quemu Arm emulator using Legv8. Scripts are stored in txt format for grading and readability

### Arm
##### pa1.txt 
The code takes a string as input, calculates the length of the string, and determines whetherthe string is a palindrome
##### pa2.txt
The code takes two integer inputs, x and y, and recursively calculates x ^ y. If y is <= 0, the output is assumed to be zero.

### Cache
##### Cache.cpp
C++ code simulates a computer cache to compare efficiency. Includes direct mapped, full associative, and set associative caches using FIFO and LRU replacement.
##### Cache Analysis
Analysis of the results of Cache.cpp

## Data Structures
Built-from scratch implementations of common data structures in Computer Science
##### MinHeap.cpp
C++ implementation of a MinHeap, a binary tree data structure where the value of each parent node is less than or equal to the values of its children nodes, ensuring the minimum value is always at the root.
##### SplayTree.cpp
C++ implementation of a splay tree, a self-adjusting binary search tree where frequently accessed nodes are moved closer to the root to improve access times, utilizing the splay operation for efficient restructuring.
##### StackQueue.py
Python implementation of stack and queue, LIFO and FIFO data structures.
##### AVL Tree
C++ implementation of an AVL tree, a self-balancing binary tree.

## Algorithms
Built-from scratch implementations of common algorithms in Computer Science
##### PageRank.cpp
C++ implementation of page rank algorithm and example usage

## Lab 6
Java implementation of connect 4

## Operating Systems
Exercises from COP4600 Fall 2022

Exercise 0

Set up and build Reptilian, a pairing of the Android and Ubuntu user space environments sharing the Linux Kernel. Output is a screenshot showing Reptilian terminal.

Exercise 1

Linux terminal commands. Create, zip, and unzip files, archives, and tar files, and view directory. Output are screenshots of the commands and a tar file.

Exercise 2

Patches, libraries, and makefiles. Create a static library to perform simple arithmetic operations and a makefile to compile that library.

Exercise 3

GDB/GNU debugger

Exercise 4

Exercise 5

Exercise 6

IO Device Files. Create a virtual storage drive via a loopback device, and represent it as a file. Connect, mount, write, unmount, and verify data has been written to the file.

Exercise 7

Exercise 8

Exercise 9

## Statistics & R
Exercises from STA 3022. Demonstrations of basic probability and statistics in R.
